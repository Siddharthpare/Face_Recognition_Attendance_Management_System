# Face-Recognition-Attendance-Project
DESCRIPTION:
The Face Recognition Attendance System is designed to automate the process of recording attendance using facial recognition technology. This system captures images of individuals, identifies them through facial recognition algorithms, and logs their attendance in a database. It is particularly useful in educational institutions, corporate offices, and other organizations where accurate and efficient attendance tracking is essential.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
1.Face Recognition Libraries and Frameworks:
OpenCV-For image processing and computer vision tasks.
Dlib-For facial feature detection and face recognition.
Face_recognition (Python library)-For easy implementation of face recognition tasks.
2.Machine Learning and Deep Learning:
TensorFlow/Kera-For training and deploying facial recognition models.
3.Database Management Systems

TASKS:
1.Design and Planning:
Define system requirements and specifications.
Design the architecture of the face recognition system.
2.Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Collect images of individuals for training and testing.
Preprocess images by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the dataset.
3.Model Training and Testing:
Train facial recognition models using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
4.System Development:
Develop the backend using Python, integrating facial recognition libraries and databases.
5.Face Detection:
Locate and identify human faces within an image or video frame.
Technologies Used: OpenCV, Haar cascades
Capture image/video frame using the camera.
Use face detection algorithms to identify the bounding boxes around faces.
Extract and preprocess the detected face regions for further processing.

DATA SOURCE: Live User using the Model
